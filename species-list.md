# There are several macrobenthic species that are sources of proteins with medical applications, including:

- Sea Urchins - their eggs contain a variety of proteins, including trypsin inhibitors and growth factors, which have potential therapeutic applications.
- Sponges - several species contain antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory compounds, as well as growth factors that could have medical applications.
- Sea Anemones - some species contain toxins that have potential use as painkillers or as drugs to treat neurological diseases.
- Cyanobacteria - they contain polypeptides with antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-tumor properties.
- Tunicates - their tunicin proteins have potential applications as wound dressings and for tissue regeneration.
- Sea Cucumbers - their extracts contain a variety of bioactive compounds, including chondroitin sulfate, which has potential use as a treatment for osteoarthritis.
- These are just a few examples of the many macrobenthic species that are sources of proteins with medical applications. Research in this field is ongoing and there may be many more such species that have yet to be discovered.
